# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Instructions**
***The navigation bar should have the following features:***

1. Main menu items:
- Display a list of main menu items, each represented by a label.
- Any main menu item should have no URL.
2.Subcategories:
- Some main menu items may have subcategories. A subcategory is represented by a label and should have no URL.
- Subcategories are displayed as drop-down menus when the user hovers over or clicks on a main menu item.
3. Highlighting active item:
- The currently selected (active) main menu item should be visually highlighted.
4.Disabled items:
- Main menu items can be disabled, preventing users from clicking on them.
